I'm Rub√©n Piquer, and I'm a soon-to-be web developer. Not much to see here yet, _but just you wait_...

### Projects :white_check_mark:
* King's Forge, a project made with some classmates last year. Our first attempt to make a webpage.

---

### Future Projects :bulb:
* For the final project of the course I'm currently studying, I'm planning on doing a full interactive map, using the Leaflet framework.

### About me :monocle_face:
* I love TTRP. I've been playing for 15 years. Specialized in **D&D, Cthulhu, Monsterhearts and City of Mist.** :zap:
* I'm a big fan of Musical Theatre. Hadestown might be my favourite musical. I've seen a few live in London. :sparkles:
